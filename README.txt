Created July 1, 2018 by Sarah Meng as a project during Radify Labs's Software Engineering week.

Prompt from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Chapter 16: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter16/
--------------------------
Umbrella Reminder

Chapter 11 showed you how to use the requests module to scrape data from http://weather.gov/. Write a program that runs just before you wake up in the morning and checks whether it’s raining that day. If so, have the program text you a reminder to pack an umbrella before leaving the house.
--------------------------

If the user wants umbrella-reminder.py to run automatically every day, then they need to set it up themselves (e.g. user Window's Task Scheduler)

The Twilio account being used is Sarah Meng's. It's on a free trial but it should be able to send a lot of text messages before it runs out of free credit.

Also see comment instructions in lines 6-8 of umbrella-reminder.py (edit the source code to change location and input own phone number)
