Created July 1, 2018 by Sarah Meng as a project during Radify Labs's Software Engineering week.

If the user wants umbrella-reminder.py to run automatically every day, then they need to set it up themselves (e.g. user Window's Task Scheduler)

The Twilio account being used is Sarah Meng's. It's on a free trial but it should be able to send a lot of text messages before it runs out of free credit.

Also see comment instructions in lines 6-8 of umbrella-reminder.py (edit the source code to change location and input own phone number)
